# 🎬 Intro
==0:00–0:15==

**SCRIPT:**
> “Ever sat down to study and thought... _'Where do I even start?'_ Notes can be long. Boring. And connections? Hidden like easter eggs in a 90s RPG.
> 
> Visual learners, this is for you.
> 
> **Welcome to BranchNote — where your notes finally make sense.**”
> // **Well i may just have the solution** *branchnote logo appears in a corner briefly*



**FOOTAGE:**

- Student sighing at wall of text → screen slowly distorts.
    
- Flash montage of walls of text, glitching arrows, over-complicated mind maps.
    
- BAM! The **BranchNote** logo appears — bold, clean, elegant tree animation with “click” sound.

# 🌿 Problem + Hook
==0:15–0:35==
**SCRIPT:**

> “But Let’s be real — reading 17 paragraphs to understand one idea?
> 
> Not it.
> 
> You scroll, you skim, you get lost…
> 
> But what if everything could just... **click**?”

**FOOTAGE:**

- Eye-level shot: someone furrowing their brow while reading.
    
- Frustration.
    
- Then, a soft chime as concepts _visually click into place_ like puzzle pieces or magnetic tiles snapping together.

## 🌳 Solution
==0:35–1:05==
**SCRIPT:**

> “Introducing **BranchNote** — your Markdown’s new best friend.
> 
> It turns your flat text into living, breathing idea trees.
> 
> Concepts branch out naturally.  
> You _see_ the structure. You _feel_ the flow.
> 
> And just like that — everything falls right into place.”

**FOOTAGE:**

- Markdown text fades into a beautiful tree diagram.
    
- Smooth animation of branches unfolding as nodes reveal.
    
- B-roll of a user leaning in as their eyes widen slightly — that “aha” moment.
    
- Keywords subtly float in: _Clarity. Focus. Flow._
